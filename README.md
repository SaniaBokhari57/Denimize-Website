# Denimize – Your Denim, Your Way
*By Syeda Sania Bokhari*

Live Website: [https://denimize-your-way-website.onrender.com/](https://denimize-your-way-website.onrender.com/)

This website was designed and developed by me using Flask, HTML, and CSS. Denimize is a fully responsive, 7-page site where users can explore products, customize denim colors, learn about the brand, and complete checkout.  

**Pages included:**
1. Home  
2. Products  
3. About Us  
4. Choose Your Color  
5. Cart  
6. Checkout  
7. Contact  

Focused on user interaction, styling, and functional design, this project demonstrates practical front-end and Flask back-end integration.

**Reason/Purpose for Building the Website:**
I chose Denimize because denim is an underexplored market in Pakistan, which I had researched during my bachelor’s studies. At that time, the project was left incomplete, so I revisited it to apply and strengthen my technical skills. By building this website, I not only brought my earlier research to life but also demonstrated my ability to translate analytical insights into a functional, user-friendly platform.
